        a habitable settlement before carefully selected and trained crews will depart to Mars. Funding and implementing this plan will not be easy, it will be hard. The Mars One team, with its advisers and with established aerospace companies, will evaluate
        and mitigate risks and identify and overcome difficulties step by step. Mars One is a global initiative whose goal is to make this everyone’s mission to Mars, including yours. If we all work together, we can do this. We’re going to Mars. Come
        along!

        <img src="img/mars5.png" alt="mars5" align="left" width="280" height="120" vspace="5" hspace="5"> Sending humans to Mars is a phenomenal undertaking by all standards and presents very real risks and challenges. Establishing a permanent settlement
        is very complex, but it is far less complex and requires much less infrastructure sent to Mars than return missions. Mars One has already started contracting established aerospace companies that will be able to develop the required systems. All
        systems require design, construction, and testing, but no scientific breakthroughs are required to send humans to Mars and to sustain life there.

        <h4>A habitable settlement will await the first crew before they depart Earth. The hardware needed will be sent to Mars in the years ahead of the humans.</h4>
